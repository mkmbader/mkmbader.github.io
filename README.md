# My website

### Workflow
Follow the workflow below for implementing changes:
* After making changes, build the website via `npm run build` in the `root` directory. This will build the project in a folder `dist`.
* Copy this folder an all contents to a folder called `docs`, and then commit. In this folder github will look for the `index.html`
